description: Use this skill when auditing technical debt, assessing code health, deciding what to refactor, or prioritizing a maintenance backlog. Categorize code, architecture, test, dependency, documentation, and infrastructure debt, score impact, risk, and effort, and produce a phased remediation plan.

# Tech Debt Management

Systematically identify, categorize, and prioritize technical debt.

## Categories

| Type                    | Examples                                             | Risk                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Code debt**           | Duplicated logic, poor abstractions, magic numbers   | Bugs, slow development   |
| **Architecture debt**   | Monolith that should be split, wrong data store      | Scaling limits           |
| **Test debt**           | Low coverage, flaky tests, missing integration tests | Regressions ship         |
| **Dependency debt**     | Outdated libraries, unmaintained dependencies        | Security vulns           |
| **Documentation debt**  | Missing runbooks, outdated READMEs, tribal knowledge | Onboarding pain          |
| **Infrastructure debt** | Manual deploys, no monitoring, no IaC                | Incidents, slow recovery |

## Prioritization Framework

Score each item on:

- **Impact**: How much does it slow the team down? (1-5)
- **Risk**: What happens if we don't fix it? (1-5)
- **Effort**: How hard is the fix? (1-5, inverted — lower effort = higher priority)

Priority = (Impact + Risk) x (6 - Effort)

## Output

Produce a prioritized list with estimated effort, business justification for each item, and a phased remediation plan that can be done alongside feature work.
